The app features Facebook login, user to user messaging, and enables users to update profiles, add, edit, or delete your cat, and allows you to comment on a cat. I created a customized logo using a google font, Sass and HTML.'

  description: 'Tandem was a group project where we decided to create a social app for cyclists. After registering for the app, you are able to update, or delete your profile, view all of the routes created by other users, create or edit a cycling route using information and maps from the Google API. A user can join another route, and members of the route are able to comment on the route. This was the first extended group project that I\'d worked on and it was a really great experience working with others to make decisions and solve issues.'

I chose the title during my research phase, and it is explained in the terms on the landing page.'
